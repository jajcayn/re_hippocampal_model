# [Re] Sharp wave ripples in the mass model of the hippocampus
*Replication of hippocampal CA3 rate model due to Evangelista et al., J. Neurosci., 2020.*

This repository contains code that replicates findings concerning sharp wave ripples in the CA3 region of the hippocampus using a simplified rate model.
The accompanying paper is currently in progress.
In order to run the code and repeat the numerical experiments, two options exist:

1. clone and run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jajcayn/re_hippocampal_model
cd re_hippocampal_model
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

2. use prebuilt docker image [coming soon!]
```
docker run -p <coming soon!>
```
